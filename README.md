# Product-Management-Process
Process Docs for Product Development Service Delivery Teams and Consultancies.

## Introduction: 
I've been Leading Agile Product Development for Consultancy Firms and Service Delivery teams for the past 15 years. Though the projects and industries I've delivered for are varied, one thing remains consistent - I keep re-writing the best practices 'run book' for how to approach Product Management and Delivery for Software projects, and training the teammembers. This is me open sourcing the info and making it available (in part so I don thave to write it again at every new company I work for ;) ). 

This work is intended to be for Product Managers, Engineers, Business Development Teams, Product Management consultancies who are trying to figure out how to optimize thier process and approach.

Technology is a tool. Our job as Technologists is to apply those tools well and justly. When we solve the right problems for the right people, we can affect real change using technology as a tool for good. Doing Product Management and Delivery well allows for this.

Feel free to contribute to the repo. I acknowldedge that for different industries slightly different approaches are appropriate. This is inteded to be a base line process and approach for deliverying aligned products/solutions, keeping teams efficeint, customers happy, all in service of making better products with a user centered approach to Product Development. 

Enjoy. 

p.s. Yes, I am available to consult for your organization on process, organizational development, training Product Development Teams and Managers in AGILE, and on specific projects.


## Business Development Phase:

+ Technical Call - Details, environments, technical reqs/limitations, â†’ Estimation. (PM, Tech Lead)
+ SOW Creation - Biz Dev Attempts to gather some of the information in this: Project SOW Proposal Plan Template
    - Project/Product Manager Lead is then responsible for getting input from a Design and Technical Lead and creating a high level estimate and project plan that operates in reality and could be reasonably delivere on with enough room/time to complete and deliver sucessfully.
    - This goes back to Biz Dev resource to put into a contract SOW along with pricing and team size and skills list.
    - SOW draft is sent through Tarun/Operations to get MSA and SOw approved ingternally
