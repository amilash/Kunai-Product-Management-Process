# Product Development (and Management) Process
How to Process Documentation for Product Development Service Delivery Teams and Consultancies. Written by a Product Managmenet Lead.

## Introduction: 
I've been Leading Agile Product Development for Consultancy Firms and Service Delivery teams as a Product Management Lead for the past 15 years. Though the projects and industries I've delivered for are varied, one thing remains consistent - I keep re-writing the best practices 'run book' for how to approach Product Management and Delivery for Software projects, and training the teammembers. This is me open sourcing the info and making it available (in part so I don thave to write it again at every new company I work for ;) ). 

This work is intended to be for Product Managers, Engineers, Business Development Teams, Product Management consultancies who are trying to figure out how to optimize thier process and approach.

Technology is a tool. Our job as Technologists is to apply those tools well and justly. When we solve the right problems for the right people, we can affect real change using technology as a tool for good. Doing Product Management and Delivery well allows for this.

Feel free to contribute to the repo. I acknowldedge that for different industries slightly different approaches are appropriate. This is inteded to be a base line process and approach for deliverying aligned products/solutions, keeping teams efficeint, customers happy, all in service of making better products with a user centered approach to Product Development. 

Enjoy. 

p.s. Yes, I am available to consult for your organization on process, organizational development, training Product Development Teams and Managers in AGILE, and on specific projects.


## Business Development Phase:
+ Client Account Discovery Meeting - (Biz Dev, Client, Dept Lead ?)
+ Discuss services, and expertise we offer.
+ Assess client needs and engagement possibilities or specific project needs over next 12 months
+ Define what we could do for them
+ Project RFP Call - Project/Product Goals, Deliverables, Milestones, features, requirements - (Biz Dev, PM Lead, Design Lead, Client)
+ Technical Call - Details, environments, technical reqs/limitations, â†’ Estimation. (PM, Tech Lead)
+ SOW Creation - Biz Dev Attempts to gather some of the information in this: Project SOW Proposal Plan Template
    - Project/Product Manager Lead is then responsible for getting input from a Design and Technical Lead and creating a high level estimate and project plan that operates in reality and could be reasonably delivere on with enough room/time to complete and deliver sucessfully.
    - This goes back to Biz Dev resource to put into a contract SOW along with pricing and team size and skills list.
    - SOW draft is sent through Tarun/Operations to get MSA and SOw approved ingternally
    - Sent to client for approval.
    - Confirm project kickoff date.
+ Internal Resourcing Meeting - Ops meeting to discuss how to staff the project, a Product Manager and Team is assigned.
+ Biz Dev hands over to Project PM Lead for Kickoff and Project Initiation and Discovery.
+ Set Up Bi-Weekly, or Monthly Feedback Session/Semi-Regular Checkins - SalesLead or Account Manager with Client
+ Respond as needed and proactively
+ Celebrate Launches and major milestones in person when possible

## Project Initiation Phase
**Sprint 0:** 
Biz Dev + Product
+ Project Kickoff Meeting
    - Client brief Team on project scope 
    - Team Brief Client on Teams project approach, and reporting needs/expectations
    - Set Sprint Cadence, schedule Agile sprint meetings (Grooming, Planning, Retro, Demo)
    - Send agenda to client outlining objectives in advance of call, 
    - Set Up Project Tools
+ Schedule Discovery Meetings for Product Roadmapping with Client 
    - Schedule time with Product Owners to develop/confirm use cases, gain approval on prioritization and stories, create MVP definition.
+ Internal Tech Kickoff:
    - Brief Engineering + Designers on project details and confirm approach.
    - Set [Team Charter](https://github.com/amilash/Product-Management-Process/blob/master/team_charter.mdv) - Shared team norms and operating procedures such as communication channels and expectations, meeting types and times, and tools and standards to be used are critical for forming high-functioning teams and delivering a successful project.
     - Discuss and agree on a common set of expectations and team norms to begin the project.
     - The [team charter](https://github.com/amilash/Product-Management-Process/blob/master/team_charter) is a living document that should be revisited at the start of each sprint and updated as lessons are learned or situations change.
+ Engineering Sprint Zero
- Teams goal is to get repos up, create accounts for the project, get credentials for any client systems, etc..
    - CI/CD pipelines + DevSecOps accounts and tools (circle CI, Jenkins, GitLab, etc..)
    - Testing suites and tools
    - Security tools (snyk, etc..)
    - Access provisioning - request access to necessary accounts from client, create accounts for project as needed (AWS, GCP, cloud hosting, testing suites (Jenkins, cucumber)
    - Set up project repos, (github, gitlabs, etc...)
    - Set up Project Managmenet Tools and Repos (Atlassian - Jira/Confluence, Gitlabs, Github Wiki, Trello, Asana, Notion, etc...)
