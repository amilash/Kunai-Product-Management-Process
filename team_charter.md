# Team Values 

(from [Raft LLC's](https://goraft.tech/) Team Values)
- **We work together and ask for help.** We don’t fall into a pit of silence trying to solve or finish something alone. Pairing is the norm.  
- **We invite feedback and give it graciously.** We ask for feedback early and often. We trust our team mates to tell us when we can do better and give us the chance to improve. We tell our them how we prefer to receive feedback and respect their preferences when we give feedback. 
- **We reflect on our own process and behaviors.** We acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them. It’s only “failure” if you fail to learn from it. We constantly look to refine and improve how we work together. 
- **We assume best intent.** We separate intention from impact. Use specific examples, and avoid generalizations. Forgive. 
- **When we see something, we say something.** Don’t be afraid to surface problems that you may become aware of, “ping” a teammate on stale ticket, or provide feedback. Acknowledge and discuss things that aren’t working well (without blame) with an eye towards improvements. Have a real chat about resolving something rather than perpetuating misunderstandings.  
- **We default to openness and transparency.** We ask questions in the open, general channels whenever possible.  
- **We state our goals explicitly and re-check them periodically.** At the beginning of meetings, we state our goals and check if there’s any reason for adjusting that goal.  At the end of meetings, we make sure to summarize commitments.
