# Human Centered Design

I am not an HCD expert, however I have incorporated HCD in product development practices thorugh Design Thinking excercises, workshops and the like for many years. Design that takes a Human Centered approach leverages best practices in mixing divergent and convergent thinking and collaborative practice wherein we empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test, implement, and retest. 
Human Centered Design is a problem solving framework used for management and product design that centers on the building empathy and relating to the human perspective as primary, and the technological tools as supportive vehicles as supportive of and for accomplishing human goals. 
Technology and software is a tool that is built for people. Remember, products that solve the right problems for the right people with iterative frameworks ameanble to adaptation and constant learning provide value and succeed.

The following are excersizes that teams will perform during Product Discovery that use Human Centered Design principles.

+ [Problem Statment Definition](#problem-statement-definition)
+ [User Personas](#user-personas)
+ [Customer Journey](#Customer-journey-mapping)
+ [User Flows](#user-flows)
+ [Affinity Mapping](#affinity-mapping)
+ [Lo-Fidelity Wireframing](#lo-fidelity-wireframing)
+ [Lo-Fidelity Wireframing](#lo-fidelity-wireframing)

## Problem Statement Definition

**Goal:** To clearly define the problem the Product will set out to solve. This information and creates a baseline of what is known about the problem space to generate initial questions and hypothesis development for how we might creat a solution. Identifying and enumerating WHO, WHAT, WHY and WHERE the problem takes place the solution.

**How-to:** 
+ Create a collaborative workspace using tools like [Mural](https://www.mural.co/) or [Miro](https://miro.com/) or by using a room full of people and a whiteboard.
+ Break down your board into 4 sections: Who, What, Where/When, Why

### Who: Brianstorming User Personas 
+ Brainstorm Personas - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually writes down on 'sticky notes' the people who A.) impacted by the issue at hand B.) will benefit from the solution.
+ Group these persona's or future users into logical groupings. You now have your main personas.
+ Vote on the order of importance of these users to identify primary and secondary personas
+ Brainstorm Personas Concerns - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually writes down on 'sticky notes' what we know about these personas or future users. This ranges from who they are and what they do to what they are responsible for, and what they care about.
+ Group them based on logical groupings.
+ Theme the groupings based on the theme that emerged.

You now know more about the users, the Personas you will design around, and the WHO we are building our product for.

### What: Define the Problem

**Goal:** To define the problem with a user focused lense. Think about "What is the problem from our Personas Perspective?" Is it easy to explain? Is it a real problem? Have we got any evidence?
e.g. TBD

For each Persona:
+ Brainstorm Problem - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually wites on 'sticky notes' the facts of the problem.
+ Group the facts if there are overlap
+ Vite on the most important facts. 3 votes per person.

You now have your hypothesis for the top Problems for your Personas/Users identified. This can later be validated by further user research, surveys, and user interviews.

### Where/When: 
What is the context in which the persona is experiencing the problem?

Can we easily explain the context?

Have we proof of the problem happending in certain contexts or spaces?

**Goal:** Give context to the environment that the problem occurs in.

For each Persona:
+ Brainstorm Context - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually writes on 'sticky notes' thier understanding and ideas of where these problem happen considering the above questions.
+ Group the contexts logically
+ Theme the groupings
+ Vote on the most important contexts
+ Document these

You now have your hypothesis of where the problem occurs. This can later be validated by user research and user interviews.

### Why should we solve this?
Why do we care? What is the most important value for the Persona/user?

What is the most important value for the organization?

Why is it worth our investment?

How does solving this impact or relate to our business goals? KPI's?

For each Persona:
+ Brainstorm Why's - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually writes on 'sticky notes' answers to the above questions
+ Group these answers logically
+ Theme the groupings and identify the main theme
+ Document the main theme groupings by each persona

For the Business or Organization:
+ Brainstorm Why's - Time box (5 minutes) a brainstorm where everyone individually writes on 'sticky notes' answers to the above questions
+ Group these answers logically
+ Theme the groupings and identify the main theme
+ Document the main theme groupings

You now have your hyothesis on why this issue matters and why we should invest in solving it for users and the organiation. This can and should be validated with your Product Owner and the Business or organization the project is being sponsored by. Add any additional learnings to your documentation when this becomes validated.

## Sythnesize your statement

Now that we have a hypotheseis derived from our understandign of the users issues, we can synthesise our problem statement.

For each section (and for each persona), WHO, WHAT, WHEN/WHERE, WHY:
+ Summarize and clearly articulate in a few sentances the main learnings and hypothesis.
+ A clear picture should emerge. If not, go back to the sections previously and consider why or why not.

You now have an articulation of your problem definition that the product aims to solve.

# User Personas

We already brainstormed who is impacted by the issue, and therefore who our product users will likely be in the [Problem Statement Definition](#Problem-statement-definition) exercise. This is who we are designing the solution for. Lets go a little deeper into what thier conerns might be and who they represent. The idea ith Personas is to create a bnotional biography for who they might be, what their role in the organization might be and therefore allow us to emapthize with them as we design the product solution with them in mind (read, for them). This is another way we ensure that we are designing technology solutions for the users- who are human people, with human problems.

For each Persona identified:
+ Create a niotional Biography for who they might be. Include information such as:
    - Name
    - Role
    - Age
    - About Me description
    - Location: Where I might live
    - Workplace: Where I work and what type of environment it is.
    - Age
    - Activities: What are the relevant things I do in my role that are related to the problem we are solving
    - Pain points: What would I say are issues and pain caused by this problem. You can pull these form the PRoblem solving workshop most likely. You can also validate these and add to them based on user interviews and or surveys.
    - Delights: What are the good things that make my day easier or that I enjoy about my work.

You now have your notional user Persona. This will help the Product Developkment team empathize and track descisiosn back to human users. These ideas should be validated by your Product Onwer/Client and validated through user interviews and or surveys.
